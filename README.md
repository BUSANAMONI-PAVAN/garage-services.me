# Project Documentation

## Getting Started

Welcome to the project! Here are the details to get started:

### For Java Projects
- This is a guideline to help you get started writing Java code in Visual Studio Code.

#### Folder Structure
- The workspace contains two folders by default:
  - `src`: the folder to maintain sources
  - `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

#### Dependency Management
- The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage dependencies. 
  - More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

---

### For Node.js Express Projects

This project is based on a GitLab [Project Template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/#create-a-project-from-a-built-in-template).

#### CI/CD with Auto DevOps
- This template is compatible with [Auto DevOps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/).
- If Auto DevOps is not already enabled for this project, you can [turn it on](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/#enable-or-disable-auto-devops) in the project settings.

#### Developing with Gitpod
- This template has a fully automated dev setup for [Gitpod](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/gitpod.html).
- If you open this project in Gitpod, you'll get all Node dependencies pre-installed.
